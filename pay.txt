Gateway	Charges per transaction
Razorpay	2% + GST (~2.36%)
Paytm	1.8% – 2.3% + GST
PhonePe	~1.8% (for UPI-based)
💡 If a ₹100 ticket is sold: you’ll pay ~₹2.36 as payment gateway fee.

💻 2. Infrastructure Costs (Hosting, DB, Bot)
If you're self-hosting:

a. Server (VPS or Cloud)
Basic server (like DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, or Render): ₹400–₹1000/month

Can run Node.js backend, MongoDB, and Telegram bot

b. MongoDB Atlas (cloud DB)
Free tier for development

Paid tier: ₹800–₹3000/month (based on traffic)

💡 For light to moderate usage, ₹1000–₹2000/month is a safe estimate.

💬 3. Telegram Bot Cost
Free. Telegram does not charge for bot usage.

🔄 4. Development & Maintenance
If you're doing this yourself, there’s no dev cost.

If outsourced:

Dev cost (one-time): ₹10,000 – ₹50,000+

Maintenance (optional): ₹1000 – ₹3000/month
